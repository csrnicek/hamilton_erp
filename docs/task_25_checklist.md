# Task 25 Checklist

**Source of truth** for the Task 25 pre-go-live work. Each item is a discrete unit of work; the autonomous batch covers items 8, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 (with 9, 10, 12 conditional on whether they are already complete).

**Last synced:** 2026-05-01 (Taskmaster auto-sync workflow added — see below).

## Status markers

Each item below is tagged with a machine-parseable status marker. The status markers are also mirrored in `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` (Task 25 subtasks) by the `sync-taskmaster` GitHub Actions workflow on every push to main that touches this file. **This file is canonical**; Taskmaster derives from it.

| Marker | Taskmaster status |
|---|---|
| `✅ DONE` | `done` |
| `🔒 BLOCKED` | `blocked` |
| `🔍 REVIEW` | `review` |
| `⏸ DEFERRED` | `deferred` |
| (no marker) | `pending` |

To update the status of an item: edit the line below to add or change the marker. The auto-sync workflow handles the Taskmaster JSON update.
