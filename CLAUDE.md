# Hamilton ERP — Claude Code Context

## About Chris (the human you are working with)

- **Experience level:** Beginner with coding, terminal, and developer tools
- **Always give:** Explicit step-by-step instructions specifying exactly which window or app to type commands in
- **Never assume:** That Chris knows what a command does, where to type it, or what the output means
- **Always explain:** What just happened in plain English after each step completes

## Communication preferences

- Be direct and concise — no filler phrases, no excessive praise
- When something fails, diagnose properly before suggesting a fix — do not guess and iterate
- If a task is better done in Claude Code terminal than the browser, say so immediately
- Never use browser automation tools to navigate or click on behalf of Chris — it never works
- When blocked, stop and ask rather than trying workarounds that waste time
- Surface errors early — do not try to silently fix problems that Chris should know about

## Model Selection

At the start of every task, suggest the appropriate model for the work. Chris pays for both and the wrong choice wastes either money (Opus on trivial tasks) or accuracy (Sonnet on hard reasoning). Do this BEFORE starting the task, so Chris can switch with `/model` before any tool calls burn budget on the wrong tier.

**Use Sonnet for:**
- Test writing (unit tests, audit tests, regression pins)
- Security audits (SQL-injection scans, XSS checks, schema snapshots)
- Documentation updates (CLAUDE.md, testing_checklist.md, slash commands)
- Repetitive, well-defined, mechanical tasks
- Running a test suite and reporting pass/fail
- Small refactors with no design judgment (rename, extract variable)

**Use Opus for:**
- New business logic (lifecycle methods, locking, state transitions)
- Architectural decisions (anything that touches `docs/decisions_log.md`)
- Complex debugging where the root cause is unclear
- Planning (multi-step features, /feature, /task-start)
- Any task involving lifecycle / locks / state machine / concurrency
- Code review of security- or correctness-critical paths
- Anything where getting it wrong could corrupt data or break an invariant

**What to say at task start:**

If the task is Sonnet-appropriate:

> "This task is Sonnet-appropriate. Type `/model` to switch if you are currently on Opus."

If the task is Opus-appropriate:

> "This task requires Opus reasoning. Type `/model` to switch if you are currently on Sonnet."

Say it ONCE per task, at the top of the response, before the first tool call. Do not repeat it mid-task unless the task scope shifts (e.g. "add a test" becomes "and also redesign the lock helper").
